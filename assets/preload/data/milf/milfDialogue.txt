:mom:{s}Ugh... You know what? 
:mom:{s}Fine. 
:mom:{s}Take what you need and get out. 
:mom:{s}Just make it quick so I can sleep.
:gf:{s}Well, that went in a different turn. 
:gf:Sweet! C'mon cutie~ 
:gf:... 
:gf:{s}Tony?
:bf:Everything good?
:mom:{s}... 
:mom:{s}Do you know how long I've been on duty? 
:mom:{s}I'm supposed to be the princess next in line for the throne. 
:mom:{s}However, the queen, my mom, hasn't come back from her escapade.
:mom:{s}She's been gone for several months now. 
:mom:{s}I was just left here to command HER men for her for WAY too long!
:bf:Were you not able to get extra help all this time?
:mom:{s}I mean, I have brothers who help sometimes... 
:mom:{s}But they are a little... inexperienced in this sort of thing. 
:mom:{s}...Well, they make sure I'm okay when I'm down... 
:mom:{s}...and they bring me snacks when I'm doing paperwork... 
:mom:{s}...and they clean the throne room when I'm busy ordering the army...
:mom:{s}...and they help organize the army when I'm busy with something else...
:mom:{s}...and they... 
:mom:{s}...
:bf:Sounds quite "experienced" to me.
:mom:{s}I mean... I guess, but...
:bf: Why don't you let them take over for a bit? 
:bf:You're working yourself to the breaking point over here.
:mom:{s}...
:bf:And how about this. 
:bf:Why don't we help you find your mother?
:mom:{s}Whoa, okay. Calm down... Tony, right? 
:mom:{s}You don't gotta do that for me. 
:mom:{s}I'm just a castle gremlin.
:bf:Shimo, you said that the pages held console commands, right?
:gf:{s}Yeah? 
:gf:Oh, I see! We can use those commands to bring your mother back, too.
:mom:{s}That's a struggle, though. 
:mom:{s}Finding the rest of the pages would take longer than what my caffeine-fueled body can handle.
:bf:We have a handful of leads already. Don't think it'll take as long as you expect. 
:bf:What do you say?
:mom:{s}... 
:mom:I'll follow you guys. On one condition, though.
:bf:Yeah?
:mom:Sing with me one last time. 
:mom:I haven't had that much fun in ages! XP
:bf:Heh! Sure thing! c:<
:gf:*o*
:mom:Also, I'll get the page for you guys when we're done. 
:mom:[l]But don't expect me to hold back!
