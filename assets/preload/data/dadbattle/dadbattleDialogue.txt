:dad:So, how do we wake up?
:gf:You boys gotta find some pages! Pages with glowing green text. 
:gf:You look at it and it moves like, SWWWOWOWOwoowowowoooo.... 
:dad:Uh huh...
:gf:Then you take them to the super computer controlling this place...
:gf:...Type the commands from the pages into the console computer...
:gf:...then BOOM! You're awake!
:dad:And what if we don't?
:gf:I dunno.
:bf:So, like a scavenger hunt. That sounds fun! 
:bf:Reminds me of when I went to a corn maze on a family trip. We had to find stamps.
:dad:We don't know what we're getting into, Tony. 
:dad:I doubt we'll just wake up when we stumble on something dangerous. 
:dad:Let's be careful, okay. 
:bf:Yeah, I know. I'm aware of the danger ahead. 
:bf:Just thought it would be a fun comparison. 
:gf:Yes! Fun! Don't forget about it. 
:gf:I look forward to knowing you all! 
:gf:Especially you~ ;)
:bf:{s}o_o
:dad:... 
:dad:{s}Well, I have been needing some time outside of the house.
:dad:{s}The air here feels nice, too.
:dad:{s}Alright. Can't stay serious forever.
:dad:{s}Let's have some fun! :]
