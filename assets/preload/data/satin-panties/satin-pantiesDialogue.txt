:bf:Well, here we are. 
:bf:{s}Kinda nervous, though. Never did a heist before...
:gf:Don't worry your pretty, little head~ 
:gf:You've made it this far. I'm sure you'll do great~ 
:gf:And if something were to happen, I'll have your back!
:bf:... Wait. 
:bf:Kestrel's army is down when she is down, right?
:gf:Yup.
:bf:So, how do we know when Kestrel herself is down? 
:gf:She takes breaks every Sunday, cutie~
:mom:[l] INCORRECT!!!
:bf:[l]{s}AHHH!!! IT WASN'T ME!!!
:gf:{s}...
:mom:[l]Ha! I heard everything! 
:mom:[l]Or at least, somewhat everything. Skimmed on some details.
:gf:{s}How, though? We heard you take breaks on Sundays.
:mom:[l]Not anymore I don't! 
:mom:[l]I started trying this new drink called "coffee"! 
:mom:[l]Haven't slept in two weeks because of it! 
:mom:[l]Now, ALL of us are on alert 24/7!
:gf:{s}What?? That can't last forever, though.
:mom:[l]Well, so far it's been pretty good! 
:mom:[l]Lemme show you how much energy this packs! 
:mom:[l]Get ready!
