:bf:[l]{s}Whoa!!! What happened?! 
:bf:[l]{s}Shimo, what just happened??!!!
:gf:[l]{s}My house!!
:monster:Ah, what a pleasant sight you have here.
:gf:{s}Ew. It's you.
:bf:{s}We told you we're not interested in your-
:monster:You two are looking for pages, correct?
:bf:{s}...
:monster:Don't worry. I'm just here to offer a deal with you. 
:monster:I may give you proper directions to the next page you seek. 
:monster:...Unlike that hooded fellow giving you a hard time.
:bf:{s}W-we're taking a break from looking for pages right now. 
:monster:Please, I insist. 
:monster:There is a nearby forest with tons of competition. 
:monster:The goal is to hunt other people, and the winner with the most hunts is rewarded with a page. 
:monster:I suggest checking that out next. Sounds thrilling!~
:gf:{s}That's too easy. What's the catch?
:monster:Still doubting me, I see? 
:monster:No worries. I've taken my payment in advance. 
:monster:Your house is now mine.
:gf:{s}[l]WHAT?!?!? YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!!!
:monster:Seems like a small price to pay for my service. 
:monster:And no worries about everyone here. I escorted them out safely. 
:bf:{s}...
:monster:And one last thing. 
:monster:Amuse me, young one. 
:monster:I've got a bone to pick with you from our last encounter. 
:monster:{s}So consider this YOUR payment next.
